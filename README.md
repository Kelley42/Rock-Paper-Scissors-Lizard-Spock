# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

This is a modified version of the original rock paper scissors game I made for a Udemy course.

Instead of typing numbers for the choices, I decided to have users type the word out. To me this is just easier than having users remember what number goes with which word.

## How to Play

Pick rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or Spock to beat the computer. 

Rules:

* Rock beats scissors and lizard.
* Paper beats rock and Spock.
* Scissors beat paper and lizard.
* Lizard beats paper and Spock.
* Spock beats rock and scissors.
